# Image Forensics Tool

## Overview

This Image Forensics Tool is a Python program designed to determine whether an image has been tampered with or is an original, unaltered image. It utilizes various techniques and algorithms commonly employed in digital image forensics to analyze and assess the integrity of the image.

## Features

- Detects common image manipulation techniques such as copy-paste, splicing, and retouching.
- Provides a confidence score indicating the likelihood of tampering.
- Supports multiple image file formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
- Offers a user-friendly command-line interface for easy usage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pulchritudinuous/ImageForensics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-forensics
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can use the Image Forensics Tool to analyze images for tampering by running the following command:

```bash
python image_forensics.py analyze -i path/to/your/image.jpg
```

### Options

- `-i`, `--image`: Specify the path to the image you want to analyze.

## Example

```bash
python image_forensics.py analyze -i examples/tampered_image.jpg
```

## Output

The tool will generate a report that includes the following information:

- Whether the image is original or tampered.
- The confidence score of the analysis.
- A visualization highlighting potential tampering regions (if applicable).
